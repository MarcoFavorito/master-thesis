# Reinforcement Learning for LTLf/LDLf Goals: Theory and Implementation

This repo contains my master's thesis: the Latex code and the PDF files.

To create the `thesis.pdf` file:

```
make thesis
```

To create the slides for the presentation (`latex-slides.pdf`):

```
make slides
```

To make both, run `make all`.


For the slides, many thanks to [@manuelcoppotelli](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli) for the [Beamer Roma theme](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli/beamer-roma-theme).
