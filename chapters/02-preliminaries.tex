\chapter{Preliminaries}
In this chapter we describe the background knowledge required for this work. We introduce Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Non-Markovian Reward Decision Process (NMRDP), common formalisms in the context of Reinforcement Learning. We describe Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (\LTLf) and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (\LDLf), that we use for define temporal goal in a RL setting. Then, we describe an important result about RL for NMRDP with \LTLf/\LDLf rewards, that is the basis for this work.
